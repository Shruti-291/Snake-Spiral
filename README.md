# Snake-Spiral
Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to eat as much as possible without crashing into walls or its own tail. The game gets harder as the snake grows, requiring quick reflexes and strategic movement. It includes a high score feature, letting players track their best performances.
